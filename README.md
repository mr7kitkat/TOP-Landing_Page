# Project Summary
This project involves creating a web page based on a provided design with two images: one displaying the complete website layout and the other detailing fonts and colors used. The task includes setting up a GitHub repository to store the project files and using the Roboto font for text content. The project encourages tackling each section individually, focusing on content before styling, and using flexbox for layout. It is recommended to commit changes regularly and follow specific steps to publish the project on GitHub Pages for web access.
